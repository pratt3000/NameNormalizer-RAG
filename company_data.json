                "Apple issued a public statement about the suicides and company spokesperson Steven Dowling said\n\nApple is saddened and upset by the recent suicides at Foxconn  A team from Apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made",
                "The statement was released after the results from the companys probe into its suppliers labor practices were published in early 2010",
                "Foxconn was not specifically named in the report but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws including Apples own rules and some child labor existed in a number of factories",
                "Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicidesAlso in 2010 workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens",
                "One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses",
                "After a high suicide rate in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones albeit a lower rate than that of China as a whole workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves",
                "Workers in factories producing Apple products have also been exposed to hexane a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the productsA 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted after Apples promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides",
                "The Pegatron factory was again the subject of review as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees",
                "The BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing as of 2010 but Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditionsIn December 2014 the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen China which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apples iPhone and iPad",
                "According to the report workers are pressured into 65hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks",
                "They are also made to reside in primitive dark and filthy dorms where they sleep on plywood with six to ten workers in each crowded room",
                "Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workersIn 2019 there were reports stating that some of Foxconns managers had used rejected parts to build iPhones and that Apple was investigating the issue",
